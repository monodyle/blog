Noto was designed by Google to be a font for the world, with the ambitious goal of encoding every character in every language into a modern typeface. The name comes from *“no tofu”*, where “tofu” is the name given to the white squares that pop up when a character is missing from a font.

> "Noto" means "I write, I mark, I note" in Latin. The name is also short for "no tofu", as the project aims to eliminate 'tofu': blank rectangles shown when no font is available for your text.
